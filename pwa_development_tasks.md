### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Pre-Development**
- [ ] **Task 1: Initial PWA Setup**
    - [ ] Set up the project repository and development environment.
    - [ ] Choose the web technology stack (e.g., React/Vite, Next.js, Angular, Vue).
    - [ ] Set up the basic PWA shell with a `manifest.json` and a service worker for offline capabilities.
- [ ] **Task 2: Address Dependencies & Concerns**
    - [ ] Coordinate with the venue to confirm and test Wi-Fi capabilities for over 100 concurrent users.
    - [ ] Plan and establish a dedicated on-site technical support team for the event day.
    - [ ] Coordinate with the venue to confirm physical accessibility arrangements.

### **Phase 2: Core Feature Development**
- [ ] **Task 3: Accessibility Foundation**
    - [ ] **Priority:** Develop the accessibility menu.
    - [ ] Implement a toggle for high-contrast mode (using CSS variables).
    - [ ] Implement a toggle for text-to-speech functionality (using the Web Speech API).
    - [ ] Ensure all initial UI components adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- [ ] **Task 4: User Authentication**
    - [ ] Design and implement the team registration form with clear, accessible labels.
    - [ ] Implement the login flow.
    - [ ] Add a confirmation message for successful registration.
    - [ ] Ensure data handling is compliant with FSCA privacy and protection standards.
- [ ] **Task 5: Navigation & Progress Tracking**
    - [ ] Develop the interactive map (e.g., using Leaflet.js) with pinch-to-zoom and station labels.
    - [ ] Ensure the map is compatible with screen readers.
    - [ ] Implement the QR code scanner using a web-based library and the device camera API.
    - [ ] Add clear audio (`<audio>` element) and haptic feedback (`navigator.vibrate()`) for successful scans.
    - [ ] Create the digital checklist that updates in real-time upon a successful QR scan.
    - [ ] Design visually distinct, high-contrast indicators for completed tasks on the checklist.
- [ ] **Task 6: Gamification & Engagement**
    - [ ] Implement the real-time leaderboard (using WebSockets or polling).
    - [ ] Develop the points and badge system.
    - [ ] Create high-contrast badge graphics with descriptive alt-text.
    - [ ] Implement the random "glitch" and "blackout" event triggers.
    - [ ] Ensure text during these events is compatible with the Web Speech API.
- [ ] **Task 7: Advanced & Support Features**
    - [ ] Develop the AR overlay engine using web-based AR (e.g., AR.js, WebXR).
    - [ ] Ensure all text within the AR experience follows contrast guidelines.
    - [ ] Implement a large, easily identifiable help/contact button.
    - [ ] Implement a multilingual interface.

### **Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **Task 8: Comprehensive Testing**
    - [ ] Conduct thorough unit and integration testing for all features.
    - [ ] Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    - [ ] Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with a focus on accessibility and usability.
    - [ ] Test the PWA's installability and offline functionality.
    - [ ] Verify that all text resizing and accessibility features work as expected without breaking the UI.
- [ ] **Task 9: Event Simulation**
    - [ ] Schedule and conduct a full "dry run" of the event with staff and volunteers.
    - [ ] Test the system under load to simulate 100+ concurrent users.

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Event Preparation**
- [ ] **Task 10: Final Preparations**
    - [ ] Deploy the PWA to a secure web host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3/CloudFront).
    - [ ] Set up HTTPS, which is required for service workers and PWA functionality.
    - [ ] Create and distribute multilingual support materials and QR codes for easy app access.
    - [ ] Train all volunteers and on-site staff on app features and accessibility best practices.
